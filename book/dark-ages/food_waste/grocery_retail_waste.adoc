From the point of view of RF, food waste at the grocery level is intertwined with the waste at the consumer level.  If consumers had access to healthy, affordable and convenient food service, they would shop less at the grocery thereby reducing waste in this area.

Apart from this link to the consumer, there are certain practices common in grocery stores that increase waste.  Some of these practices are highlighted here to emphasize the incentize for consumers to divest from this industry and toward RF-inspired food service.

The wasteful practices in the grocery store mirror that of the consumer in the sense that they are both fueled by speculation.  If the consumer speculates on what they will eat over the coming days, the grocery can be said to speculate on the consumers' speculation.  In other words, the grocery store tries to predict what the consumer will eat so that it can appropriately stock inventory.  Like the consumer, the threat of erring on too little inventory and running out of stock is greater than the threat of waste.  Therefore, the grocery store errs on the side of waste.  This behavior has a strong incentive because people come to the store with detailed plans and if they discover an ingredient is out of stock, this could force an entire change of plans and cause the consumer to shop at a different store with more ample stocks.

Finally, there is an element of vanity in the grocery stores in which they believe that abundant stocks of ingredients sell better than sparse ones.  This probably ties back to the previous point of assuaging consumers' fear of sold out ingredients.  In effect, the grocery store wants consumers to see an over-abundance of product.  However, an over-abundance implies more than is needed, which in turn implies waste.  Therefore, waste is an intentional part of the grocery business model.
