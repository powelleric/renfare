This section will explore the motivating forces behind the static menu business model and how fresh produce figures into the picture.

 Most restaurants in America have a menu with a variety of items and it stays mostly the same year after year. This is what will be referred to as a static menu. 

 The static menu is popular because it facilitate a simple business strategy: specializing in a handful of dishes. The inventory and the recipes are always the same and customers know what to expect. It makes the business manageable at a very small scale, even with just a single person.

 Where the static menu falls short is in relation to fresh produce. 



The initial driver for the static menu comes from the business owner's desire for a simple business model. A static menu means that the establishment can specialize in a handful of dishes. Menu-planning occurs once in the beginning, rather than being an ongoing task. By extension, the marketing and sales strategies need not change since the product does not change.

The consistency offered by the static menu means that customers have a clear expectation of what is offered.  Things are predictable.

Within this context, it is obvious that having a constant price for the dishes perfectly completes the model.  It would be a shame if a customer came for their favorite dish only to find that it was too expensive that day. Furthermore, it is natural (though not entirely correct) for the customer to expect the same item to cost the same amount from day-to-day; Most goods behave in this manner.

Fresh produce availability, on the other hand, can vary widely over the course of the year.  The more perishable the ingredient and the more seasonal it is, the greater the variability.  This can be the difference between getting an item directly from a nearby grower (for a bargain) in-season and getting it from half-way around the world a few months later.

In theory, there is no reason why the menu items couldn't vary in price along with the produce. However, this flies in the face of the static-menu mindset. Recall, the motivating force behind the static-menu is simplicity and predictability, but changing the price of each dish according to the market rates of its constituent ingredients is far from trivial.

 It would first require calculating the price - surely entailing a spreadsheet, at minimum - then the price change must be updated on the menu, and still the customer would not know any of this until visiting. And then how often would this need to be done?

One might argue that you could simply average of cost of the produce for the year and then keep the price consistent. In practice, this is likely to be rather difficult.  First off, the price cannot be perfectly predicted. A cursory look at commodities markets should convince anyone of that. Second, the more perishable and seasonal the ingredient, the more it can be affected by aberrations such as natural disasters. Finally, if there is any seasonality in the sales of the food, then that too must be predicted and incorporated in the calculation. 

After all this, should the business owner succeed in perfectly averaging out the cost of ingredients over the year, all they will have achieved is consistency for the consumer.  Indeed, to the extent that they stabilize the cost to the consumer, it is their own finances that are the buffer, resulting in fluctuating profit margins throughout the year relative to the price of produce (and complicating financial analyses).

Therefore, to achieve the final piece of the static menu business model, a consistent price, fresh produce is marginalized because it represents financial uncertainty and complexity. 

=== Always in stock

Another hallmark of the static menu business model is that all items are always in stock.  Of course, this is desirable for a consumer because they never have to worry that their favorite dish will be sold out. It can even risk giving the impression of a poorly run establishment if menu items are sold out. 

But to keep all items in stock means having sufficient inventory at all times for your highest possible sales.  This may be a trivial requirement or a crushing burden depending on the model of the restaurant.  The two key factors that determine the impact are 1) how perishable the ingredients are and 2) how many items are on the menu.

We have already established that the static menu almost always offers a variety of different dishes.  Therefore, the only way for it to achieve the "always available" component of the business model, is to favors meat and grains and processed ingredients, which are less perishable than fresh produce. This translates into less waste when sales aren't at their peak. As an added benefit, meat, grains and other processed foods tend to be more nutrient dense, meaning less storage space is required for the excess inventory.

== Prep times

The situation gets worse when we compare fresh produce to its alternatives in terms of preparation.  It has been noted that the static menu favors dishes that are prepared-to-order.  Moreover, the variety of dishes on the menu makes it quite difficult to predict exactly what will be ordered. Therefore, preparation time is of the utmost importance for such an establishment.

 Another common characteristic of the food service industry is a menu of prepared-to-order food.  Indeed, preparing food to order is often seen as a symbol of quality in the operation. Furthermore, preparing food to order often offers the opportunity to customize the dish. 

 The consequences of preparing food to order come in the form of scale and efficiency.  Because each dish must be prepared individually, there is very little drop in marginal labor cost when preparing larger quantities.  Nor is it quick to prepare such food in large quantities, sometimes leading to long waits.  This is exacerbated by consumers having the option to customize their dishes, meaning that even when multiple orders for the same dish are received, the cook may not be able to make a bigger batch due to relatively minor things like differing spice levels or protein selection.

Dishes that do not rely on fresh produce often can leverage processed ingredients to yield quick preparation times. This may mean pre-seasoned, pre-portioned, ready-to-cook, pre-cooked or any number of conveniences.

By contrast, fresh produce can entail extensive preparation, requiring things like washing and peeling before even beginning to cook. And with cooking times that can be sometimes be much longer. 

== Processed foods more tasty

A related topic to preparation time is the recipe itself. It is more difficult to prepare dishes with fresh produce than with processed foods because the latter are industrially engineered to be hyper-palatable. This is not to say such food is the pinnacle of cuisine (nor that it is healthy), but it can certainly tantalize the taste-buds with its high levels of sugar, sodium and refined ingredients.  As noted, it's preparation time is usually quick and does not involve complicated or labor intensive steps. In this sense, processed foods offers a shortcut for establishments who are not up to the task of scratch cooking.

=== Customized food

A curious characteristic that is often found with the static menu is the concept of customizing one's dish.  Most establishments will allow modifications to the dish and some even encourage it.

It would seem that for a business model craving simplicity and clinging to a fixed set of dishes that allowing modifications to the dishes invites unneeded complexity.  On the other hand, it is easy to rationalize that since each dish is prepared to order that it takes a negligible amount of time to add or remove a given ingredient. (Also, it allows a fixed set of dishes to appeal to a wider audience.)

While this may be true, there are still other negative factors. First, it further inhibits the ability to predict what will be ordered. Second, it slows down the ordering process. Third, it opens up a minefield of issues with customers not getting the customizations they requested (either because the staff forgot do it or perhaps because the customer thinks they asked for something they did not). Fourth, it adds cognitive overhead to the cook having to handle all the customizations.

Thus, while some establishments serving some dishes may be able to accommodate some customizations without much suffering, it will rarely scale at the level RF aspires to.

 Customizations are a way of upselling, maximizing the current sale.  

 These customizations can allow diners to create the perfect dish to satisfy their cravings or conform to their personal allergy requirements. 



 A common theme is the food service industry is the customization of your dish.  Restaurants offer all manner of add-ons and substitutions to cater to a variety of different preferences and dietary needs.


 This may mean that they include preservatives or are pre-cooked. o meat, grains and processed ingredients often leverage processing can come directly out of the packaging

 Not really a tipping point
 The previous section introduced a tipping-point, the point at which a restaurant can sell enough of a single fresh produce ingredient that it becomes economical to source it directly from the grower. The defining characteristic of a tipping is not just that one side now outweighs the other, it is that the fundamental forces now also favor the other. 

 This marks the point where we are firmly on the road to healthy, affordable and convenient food service.  Up until this point, the principles discussed (e.g. efficiency) could be applied to any food service, but it is the application of these principles in order facilitate the use of fresh produce that represents the beginning of possibilities in the new paradigm. 

== Menu & supply chain


This is convenient not just because it makes the concept of the static menu feasible, but also because the distributors often serve as a single point of contact for a variety of other ingredients, beyond just the produce that necessitates them.

The catch is that produce sourced from a different part of the world is not the same as locally-grown produce; It is likely to be more expensive and less fresh.

__At the minimum, there are the costs of transport, sometimes called "food miles", to consider. But more often this is accompanied by other factors, such as waste and diminished quality.  As a rule, the more perishable the produce, the more likely it is that the upstream growing techniques will be altered to mitigate spoilage, such as picking produce early.  These techniques almost always result in lower quality.__

Neither is the trouble over once the produce is in hand.  Spoilage is a big factor in restaurants and the static menu prevents changing the menu or the price, leaving restaurants with little means to combat impending spoilage.

 In summary, fresh produce introduces variability in cost and quality into the static menu business model.  Moreover, the static menu leaves little opportunities to adapt to the variability. Thus, on a theoretical level, we would expect the role of fresh produce to be minimized/limited in static menus. This is consistent with what is observed in reality in which processed ingredients form the bulk of what is served.


 the convenience of obtaining an off-season ingredient comes at an added cost.  Moreover, this cost fluctuates throughout the year. Combined with concerns of spoilage, these factors discourage the use of fresh produce in a static menu.__

== Plan to fail or plan to scale


Compare this to a restaurant with a single, ready-to-serve dish. There is no comparison, so to speak. This approach is so much more efficient that it not only has the potential for massive reductions in marginal cost, it also does not suffer from long waits at peak times because, by definition, the food requires minimal prep before serving and there is no question about what will be ordered nor customizations to it. 

- __Certain dishes can even take advantage of industrial-scale equipment, offering enormous reductions in marginal cost.  Further more, there is no requirement that the equipment even be located at the point-of-sale.  It could just as easily be located off-site with the point of sale responsible only for minimal final preparation and serving.__


== Upstream effects of menu choice

The previous section examined common restaurant characteristics and their shortcomings in regards to efficiency and disincentives towards fresh produce. Finally, it contrasted that with an RF-inspired restaurant that serves only a single, ready-to-serve dish.

It has already been noted that the RF-style of restaurant will be much more efficient at preparing and serving the food. This section goes further and considers the unique opportunities that arise before the food is even delivered, opportunities in the supply chain.

=== Transaction costs

 The supply chain of a static menu restaurant was touched upon earlier and it was noted that distributors play a critical role in their supply chains due the static menu business model.

To understand this more clearly it is helpful to introduce the concept of transaction costs. Each item that a restaurant needs requires an investment of time to arrange and execute the sale. This is the transaction cost. The amount of time it requires can vary widely. For example, getting produce direct from the grower often entails high transaction costs relative to a distributor.  

For a static-menu restaurant, in particular, sourcing each type of fresh produce directly from the farmer would result in extremely high transaction costs relative to a distributor.  This is a combination of two factors.  

- The static menu requires a consistent supply of produce year-round, requiring multiple growers in different geographic regions to achieve a consistent supply of each ingredient.
- The static menu offers a wide variety of dishes, which increases the number of different ingredients, requiring additional growers/transactions.

Finally, it is important to emphasize that despite the variety of produce required by the static menu, the overall amount of produce used in the menu is minimal relative to meat and grains. Because transaction costs are often fixed costs, they can quickly outweigh other factors when quantities are small. This is important because a grower __can__ offer substantially lower prices, however the static menu restaurant likely cannot purchase a large enough quantity for the cost savings to outweigh the transaction costs.

Effectively, it is a case of cutting out the middle-man. This may not mean much to a static menu restaurant, but an RF restaurant could leverage the reduced cost of raw ingredients very effectively.  It would be able to tailor the dishes specifically to those ingredients and to adjust the price to incentivize sales. 

Another advantage of an RF restaurant is that is relies on prepare-in-advance dishes.  In general, such dishes have significantly lower marginal labor cost, meaning that the ingredients account for a larger proportion of the overall cost.  Therefore, savings in produce cost by sourcing directly from the grower can more substantially reduce the marginal cost of the final product in an RF-style restaurant. For a high-volume business, this could be even be more valuable than increased sales. 

 In turn, savings in this area are more significant.  

 This is not only a reflection of how much convenience is offered by distributors; It is also a reflection of how little fresh produce is used and how rigidly it fits into a static menu.  If, on the other hand, we consider a restaurant in the new paradigm, one that is able to tailor their day's menu to a given ingredient and is capable of serving large volumes of food, the benefits of sourcing local ingredients could be enormous, even despite the transaction costs.  This is because a large enough quantity of a single ingredient is being used that the savings from cutting out the distributor outweigh the increased transaction costs. 

 When the static menu was introduced, the distinction between globally sourced produce versus locally grown produce was made.  This made it seem as though the locally grown produce would be an obvious choice when available, but in practice even that is not so. 

 Businesses will still need a distributor for other things and the extra time it takes to arrange a separate order for a couple of local ingredients can be a deal-breaker __barrier to the entire transaction__.

 The significance of this event cannot be overstated.  For once, fresh produce will represent a strategic opportunity in the business model.  Restaurants will be incentivized to use as much of the locally sourced ingredient as possible because they will be obtaining it at wholesale cost and the transaction cost is fixed.  That will result in menu items that incorporate much more produce than in the average person's current diet.
