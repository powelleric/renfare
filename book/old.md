# Bare necessities

Food is incredibly important to our society.  This goes far beyond the basic needs for survival, as the choices we make about food impact our long-term quality of life, economy and global ecosystem.

Given the critical role that food plays in our society, the relative scarcity Of healthy, sustainable and affordable food services is striking.  Indeed, I would contend that this is an unmet demand in the market and represents a unique opportunity to diversify and strengthen the economy.

Given the critical role that food plays in our society, I find it both strange and deeply concerning that there have not been greater efforts to ensure the availability of healthy, sustainable and affordable food services.  Indeed, I would contend that this represents an unmet demand in the market and a unique opportunity to diversify and strengthen the economy.

Unfortunately, the situation is not quite so simple.  While few would object to the general sentiment of wanting more affordable, healthy and sustainable food, a great many would argue that the status quo is what it is for a reason, that in fact it is not possible to make healthy and sustainable food any cheaper (barring any government intervention in the markets).  After all, if it were possible to provide such a commodity, why wouldn't we see businesses rushing to meet this demand?

## The elephant in the kitchen

Part of the problem is simply that it is hard to see past what we have already.  The food services industry comprises a vast array of businesses and distributors, organized in a highly optimized and intricately complex network of businesses making up the current food services industry.

And by most accounts, this is working terrifically well.  The chart below from the USDA shows that the proportion of food expenses that occur outside of the home is steadily growing. 

So how can such a thriving industry be deficient in arguably the most important product, healthy, sustainable and affordable food? 

The answer is simply that our current models of food service were not designed to provide it;  They are the wrong tool for the job.  Thus, although we have the impression of an industry that is constantly evolving, in terms of the core business model what we are actually seeing are minor permutations of existing models rather than true innovation.  There is no reason, therefore, to expect the outlook for healthy, affordable and sustainable food to be any different in the future.

A new model of food service is required if we ever hope to see a change in the trend.  In what follows, I will present the current shortcomings of existing food service models and I will show how a different model could actually turn these weaknesses into a strengths.  In the end, I hope to convince you not just of the potential for such an idea but also of its necessity.

# A new breed

Food is just like any other commodity: if you want to offer it at a cheaper price point, you need produce it in a larger volume.  This is often referred to as scale, and it is precisely the concept which is seemingly absent in the current foodservice industry.

On the bright side, a new different model of food service is within reach, one which is designed to offer HAS food.  What is more, our current information-age will make this more feasible than ever before.

A foodservice model geared toward HAS has the following characteristics:

* A very limited number of dishes are served each day
* Dishes are chosen based on seasonal and market availability
* Dishes that can be transported and/or reheated are strongly preferred 
* Dishes are vegetarian or include small portions of meat

Apart from these basic principles, the business that I am proposing is very similar to what we already expect from a restaurant.  And do note that many of these characteristics can be found in existing restaurants.  However, it is the combination of all of them together that opens the door to new possibilities.

Make no mistake, the idea I am proposing is ambitious.  Both in its scope and in its implementation, there are numerous challenges to be addressed.  At its core, it represents a true paradigm shift in our approach to food service.   Nevertheless, in the remainder of this article, I hope to convince you not just of the potential for such an idea but also of its necessity.

The idea itself is deceptively simple: a restaurant that serves only a couple dishes each day. That is all.  Yet what I will attempt to show is that something so basic on the surface actually has far-reaching implications within the context of our modern society.  I will demonstrate that this style of restaurant is qualitatively different than virtually any other restaurant.

The word qualitative has particular significance in the previous sentence.  It means something with different qualities, something that is bound by different rules, and something that, ultimately, has dramatically different possibilities.

stem from a number of factors, including changes in societal demographics and patterns of commercial investment.

The key word there is trust.  The consumer needs to be able to trust the entity they work with, and furthermore, that trust has to be earned.  I believe that the most direct and perhaps the only way to earn and maintain that trust is through transparency.  Luckily, there is a great deal of headway to be made in that regard, and thus a lot of room to hope that trust can be fostered.

The revised nutrition facts proposed here are a good step.  Disclosing the recipe - not just the ingredients - is another concrete step towards convincing consumers that this is not just business as usual.
