# Bare necessities

Food is incredibly important to our society.  This goes far beyond the basic needs for survival, as the choices we make about food impact our long-term quality of life, economy and global ecosystem.

Given the critical role that food plays in our society, the relative scarcity Of healthy, sustainable and affordable food services is striking.  Indeed, I would contend that this is an unmet demand in the market and represents a unique opportunity to diversify and strengthen the economy.

Given the critical role that food plays in our society, I find it both strange and deeply concerning that there have not been greater efforts to ensure the availability of healthy, sustainable and affordable food services.  Indeed, I would contend that this represents an unmet demand in the market and a unique opportunity to diversify and strengthen the economy.

Unfortunately, the situation is not quite so simple.  While few would object to the general sentiment of wanting more affordable, healthy and sustainable food, a great many would argue that the status quo is what it is for a reason, that in fact it is not possible to make healthy and sustainable food any cheaper (barring any government intervention in the markets).  After all, if it were possible to provide such a commodity, why wouldn't we see businesses rushing to meet this demand?

## The elephant in the kitchen

Part of the problem is simply that it is hard to see past what we have already.  The food services industry comprises a vast array of businesses and distributors, organized in a highly optimized and intricately complex network of businesses making up the current food services industry.

And by most accounts, this is working terrifically well.  The chart below from the USDA shows that the proportion of food expenses that occur outside of the home is steadily growing. 

So how can such a thriving industry be deficient in arguably the most important product, healthy, sustainable and affordable food? 

The answer is simply that our current models of food service were not designed to provide it;  They are the wrong tool for the job.  Thus, although we have the impression of an industry that is constantly evolving, in terms of the core business model what we are actually seeing are minor permutations of existing models rather than true innovation.  There is no reason, therefore, to expect the outlook for healthy, affordable and sustainable food to be any different in the future.

A new model of food service is required if we ever hope to see a change in the trend.  In what follows, I will present the current shortcomings of existing food service models and I will show how a different model could actually turn these weaknesses into a strengths.  In the end, I hope to convince you not just of the potential for such an idea but also of its necessity.

# A new breed

Food is just like any other commodity: if you want to offer it at a cheaper price point, you need produce it in a larger volume.  This is often referred to as scale, and it is precisely the concept which is seemingly absent in the current foodservice industry.

On the bright side, a new different model of food service is within reach, one which is designed to offer HAS food.  What is more, our current information-age will make this more feasible than ever before.

A foodservice model geared toward HAS has the following characteristics:

* A very limited number of dishes are served each day
* Dishes are chosen based on seasonal and market availability
* Dishes that can be transported and/or reheated are strongly preferred 
* Dishes are vegetarian or include small portions of meat

Apart from these basic principles, the business that I am proposing is very similar to what we already expect from a restaurant.  And do note that many of these characteristics can be found in existing restaurants.  However, it is the combination of all of them together that opens the door to new possibilities.

Make no mistake, the idea I am proposing is ambitious.  Both in its scope and in its implementation, there are numerous challenges to be addressed.  At its core, it represents a true paradigm shift in our approach to food service.   Nevertheless, in the remainder of this article, I hope to convince you not just of the potential for such an idea but also of its necessity.

The idea itself is deceptively simple: a restaurant that serves only a couple dishes each day. That is all.  Yet what I will attempt to show is that something so basic on the surface actually has far-reaching implications within the context of our modern society.  Specifically, what I will demonstrate is that actually this style restaurant is qualitatively different than virtually any other restaurant.  

The word qualitative has particular significance in the previous sentence.  It means something with different qualities, something that is bound by different rules, and something that, ultimately, has dramatically different possibilities.

We will examine each of these factors 


Reflecting upon the statistics relating to obesity, food waste and environmental destruction, it is disheartening.

The reasons behind how such a critical resource could be so neglected stem from a number of factors,
including changes in societal demographics and patterns of commercial investment.

# Organic is not enough

The organic food movement has brought many benefits to society.  Accompanied by a much larger interest in the content of products eg. non-gmo.

Driven by a desire for healthier food and better ecological practices, the rise in organic products allows consumers to exercise their preferences when purchasing products.

#### Raising awareness

Beyond the actual measurable market for these products, the mere preponderance of products containing certified ingredients has prompted many consumers to be more discerning in their choices and simultaneously empowered with the ability to act on their new-found preferences.

Furthermore, these new preferences are motivated by virtuous desires of health and ecological sustainability.  Therefore, it is hard to criticize a system that empowers consumers to act on such noble sentiments.  This heightened awareness of production practices and greater scrutiny of producers is motivated by concerns over health and environmental impacts.

#### Certification

One of the single biggest factors that has catalyzed this movement is the creation of official certifications for organic products.  This allowed consumers to trust what was being marketed to them and signaled that it was safe to factor their preferences in their buying decisions.  It addressed major concerns over the authenticity of the products that they were buying.

#### Certification downsides

If we consider certification at a macro economic level, its value derives from its ability to ameliorate a deficiency in information at the consumer level.

The driving factor concerns trust between the consumer and the producer.  Put simply, consumers (rightfully) felt that they could not trust the claims made by manufacturers.  The term "organic" was being used loosely and in a way that consumers found misleading.  This mistrust caused otherwise willing consumers to shy away from organic products for fear of deception. Having a certification by a third-party acted as a bridge between this trust gap and allowed the market to function again. 

At a much more subtle level, certification has had the (perhaps unintended) effect of simplifying decisions over inherently complex matters.  If we consider the environmental impacts of agricultural production, there are numerous factors that must be considered and the specifics often vary between products.

For example, xxx publishes an annual report entitled "The Dirty Dozen".  This is a list of the 12 produce items with the highest pesticide content.  The takeaway is that consumers should consider purchasing organic or pesticide-free varieties of these products relatively more than products not on this list. 

Keeping track of relative rankings such as this and factoring this into purchasing decisions in addition to universal factors such as cost and availability is incredibly taxing.  There is truly no end to the optimization of these factors across the changing seasons and market fluctuations.

In the context of such complex multi-faceted decisions, organic certification acts as a de facto stamp of approval. The consumer does not need to understand any of the intricacies and can simply trust that products with this certification are "good".

#### Shortcomings

The previous discussion of certification's role in the market likely raised a few red flags in the minds of readers.  If consumers feel that they cannot trust manufacturers, then to what extent does third-party approval actually remedy this dysfunction?  If environmental impacts from agricultural production is really such a complex topic, then to what extent can it be reduced to a dualistic good vs bad stamp of approval?

If we view certification as a tool to facilitate consumers health and environmental preferences, then there are several areas in which certification falls short.

The first category of short-comings is that of products which comply with organic certification.  To what extent has the attainment of this certification caused producers to change agricultural practices that were not in fact problems to begin with.  Use of fertilizers is a prime example.  If a producer adheres to every organic practice apart from the use of an inorganic fertilizer, does that truly merit their barring from the premium shelf?  What if that fertilizer was only used during a small window of the life cycle or if the organic alternative was many times more expensive?  Knowing that organic products can often sell for much more than conventional ones, does that mean that this producer's crop should be relegated to the lower price point for this sole decision?  This actually undermines consumers desire for healthy and sustainable food in its draconian application.  What we see then is that the certification designed to ameliorate the information gap has actually only created a narrow bridge across the gap and anything that falls through that gap.

#### Trust and transparency

Having reviewed the role of certification at the macro economic level and its inherent shortcomings, it now begs the question of what a better system would look like.  From a theoretical perspective, the (apparent) need for certification arose from a deficiency of information at the consumer level.  Yet by the same token, we see that even in cases where ample information is available, evaluating all of that information in the context of daily meals is unrealistic.  Neither is this how we operate in other sectors of the economy.  The consumer trusts a professional for healthcare, financial planning and even more mundane things like car repair.

The key word there is trust.  The consumer needs to be able to trust the entity they work with, and furthermore, that trust has to be earned.  I believe that the most direct and perhaps the only way to earn and maintain that trust is through transparency.  Luckily, there is a great deal of headway to be made in that regard, and thus a lot of room to hope that trust can be fostered.

The revised nutrition facts proposed here are a good step.  Disclosing the recipe - not just the ingredients - is another concrete step towards convincing consumers that this is not just business as usual.

Drawing from basic economic principles, it can be seen that complete information is a prerequisite of a true competitive market.
