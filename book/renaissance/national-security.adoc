A potentially overlooked topic in the food system discussion is the influence of the government in the interest of national food security. Silos of grain symbolize months of meals on hand. It really serves to explain much of conventional agriculture and food-related legislature. If you choose your food system based on what would be most robust in a wartime situation, then the quality of the food and the environmental degradation are completely secondary.  It's really just a calories game at that point, the cheaper and easier the better.

RF offers a different take on national security. It argues that the conventional food system is so consolidated and centralized that a disruption at a single large entity could threaten the livelihood of huge numbers.  It is brittle. This has been demonstrated amply by food recalls and factory disasters. RF argues that a more robust system consists of diverse interconnected network of many entities instead of a system with a small number of "too-big-to-fail" entities.

The wartime thought exercise quickly becomes a question of self-reliance.  Often this is thought of in terms of the individual or a family.  However, self-reliance at the community level is arguably a more worthy area of focus.  This is a question of how resilient a community is to supply chain interruptions.  RF encourages communities to invest in commercial food preparation and encourages workers to know how to prepare dishes from a wide variety of whole foods.

RF also offers the potential for enormous growth in the food service sector.  This means a greater chance of people in your community with food skills.  The conventional service instead outsources enormous amounts of preparation in the form of processed foods. Food service workers, in turn, only know how to work with processed ingredients and not with whole foods.  In that way, the conventional system encourages a bigger failure point: people need not just food but also pre-processing in order to feed their local community.  And they certainly aren't encouraged to make maximal use of local ingredients available plentifully in season.

In terms of local communities, it is not just the skills but also the equipment needed to prepare food in large quantities.  As noted, conventional food service outsources part of the preparation to factories when it purchases processed food.  Secondly, it prepares the food to order, which means that it prepares the food in small batches.  This is much less efficient than preparing food in larger batches, but larger batches can require additional space and large equipment. These are investments that need to be made now, not in war time.  

Finally, there is the sobering understanding that, what were once a secondary consideration is increasingly becoming a primary one.  An obese population reliant on prescription medications and soil that won't grow food without being doused in chemicals.  These shortcomings are their own national security weakness.  How much stronger would the nation be if it curbed the obesity trend and relied less on fossil fuel and industrial chemicals to produce food, allowing those resources to be devoted to the hypothetical wartime effort.  War times can cause supply chain interruptions, making reliance on prescriptions to treat lifestyle conditions an unnecessary weakness.
