RF is a radical idea.  Although this can sometimes carry a negative connotation, none is implied here.  Much to the contrary, RF wears its radicalism as a badge of honor, for the situation at hand demands a radical solution.

Society faces enormous and deeply-entrenched challenges on a number of fronts. That these challenges have persisted for decades despite numerous efforts indicates that they are deeply entrenched. Part of the reason that these issues have failed to be addressed is because the solutions are not bold enough, not comprehensive enough.

The reasons that the solutions have not been radical enough is because, in a sense, we have not sought radical solutions.  We have looked to government and universities to tackle the issue, but these institutions are in the business of small, iterative solutions.  They look for ideas that can offer a carefully-placed modification to the existing system, the system that has been studied and which is the framework for their understanding. They seek to predict the outcome of their modification and what investment it will require.  Put simply, they seek solutions for which there are clear answers and clear paths to implementation.  And rightly so, for these are publicly-funded institutions that would look remiss were they to suggest radical ideas with no clear timeline or expectations.  

 But then who is to suggest such ideas?

The ideas offered by government and academia do not aspire to the lengths that we require.  Looking at the trends in obesity, environmental destruction and labor, we see years of continued attrition.  This slide is on the forefronts of many discussions, routinely making appearances in political discourse.  After such a prolonged decline, is a slight dampening of the trends sufficient?  Should society be content with simply slowing the trend?  This is the best possible outcome for the vast majority or ideas on the table, and the most likely outcome is far less than that.  RF offers the possibility of truly reversing the saddening trends of recent history.

A further criticism of small, incremental approaches is that gains in one area can potentially exacerbate other areas.  Take the issue of food insecurity.  Studies show that food programs targeting food insecurity are often dominated by highly processed foods.  Thus, the resolution of food insecurity begets issues with health and obesity, (undoubtedly still a huge improvement).  In turn, addressing the issue of obesity (via a diet richer in whole foods) has the potential to exacerbate the environmental problems associated with conventional crop production.

 These criticisms on narrowly-focused on policy measures are neither here nor there, for if the gains they seek were to be realized, then the consequences would be surely outweighed, (just as unhealthy food is infinitely more preferable than no food.)  The real issue is that there is little hope of even achieving their narrowly-focused goals.

RF is the only solution that is radical enough to conceivably make progress on all of these fronts.  It is the only solution that could take a person facing food insecurity and not only feed them, but offer them healthy food, produced with environmentally friendly methods and perhaps even offer them gainful employment along the way.  It is the proverbial tale of not simply giving a hungry person a fish, but instead teaching them to fish so that they can provide for themselves (and potentially others) in perpetuity.
