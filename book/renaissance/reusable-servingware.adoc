If society were to adopt RF and consumers increasingly got their meals from food service, it could lead to a proliferation of packaging waste.  The principles of RF do nothing to deter food service from using disposable containers.  Increasing numbers of food service establishments use disposable containers for all their orders, even people dining in.  This keeps the preparation for every order the same and can even be cheaper than cleaning/maintaining reusable servingware. Arguably, disposable containers are only cheaper for the restaurant because it does not bear the externalities of the waste.  Increasing evidence suggests that plastic waste is harming our ecosystems and our bodies.

Even though RF is susceptible to the appeal of disposable containers, it enables some advanced developments in food service that could curb the use disposable containers. The crux of the issue with reusable servingware is in the consumer returning it when they are finished.  In the worst case, this ends up being an errand on the other side of town that the consumer must do.

Even in the worst case, one way to lighten this burden is simply by taking more containers on each trip.  In other words, to eat more RF meals.  Because RF is focused on value to the consumer, this is a much more reasonable proposition than increasing consumption of static menu food service.


- Standardized servingware facilitates comparisons between food offerings.

- Automat removes the retail requirement from food service.

This can easily turn into a burden for the consumer and deter them from choosing it.
