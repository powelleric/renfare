== Food waste 

The consumer wastes much more than retail. Does that indicate there is a lot of room for improvement there? Maybe not. Means the consumer is overwhelmed.


RF could create food scraps that are not heavily processed, containing preservatives, etc.  More useful in a circular economy.

Farming is too speculative. Crop prices change, etc.  A CSA model removes a great deal of the speculation.  Also, food service serves as a direct conduit of consumer preference. The intermediaries buy speculatively based on price.  Food service buys to use it directly. Better gauge of usage than commodities markets.
