= Flexible pricing

- Flexible pricing is a boon to RF

- Flexible pricing more important for value-oriented business model
  - Pennies matter more when you have smaller margins
	- Online shopping may have helped pave the way for customer acceptance of varying prices and non-vanity prices.

- Inflexible pricing could be the reason that establishments resort to "back of house" fees.
	- They don't know how to raise their prices because they are so vain and insecure that they fear if the prices on their menu items aren't round numbers then customers won't come.  Perhaps it will throw off the chic look of the menu.
	- Then when the prices of their inputs inevitably rise by a few percent, they have no way to increase their prices in tandem.  They can only increase their prices in big increments, and even then may be disincentived by having to re-print menus, etc.
