Instead of a dedicated server, more efficient.
- More efficient to use apps
  - Customer would be better served by using an app for requests or even just getting it themselves from a station.
- Old dysfunctional model, resisting technology because it is less profitable
  - If everything was through app, harder to ask for gratuity, meaning restaurants would have to pay a standard wage to servers.
