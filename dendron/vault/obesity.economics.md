_The principal hypothesis to be tested is that an increase in the prevalence of obesity is the result of several economic changes that have altered the lifestyle choices of Americans. One important economic change is the increase in the value of time, particularly of women, which is reflected by the growth in their labor force participation rates and in their hours of work. The reduction in home time, due in part to the slow growth in income among certain groups, has been associated with an increase in the demand for convenience food. Another important change is the rise in the real cost of cigarette smoking due to increases in the money price of cigarettes, the diffusion of information concerning the harmful effects of smoking, and the enactment of state statutes that restrict smoking in public places and in the workplace. This relative price change may have reduced smoking, which tends to increase weight. A final set of relative price changes revolves around the increasing availability of fast food, which reduces search and travel time and changes in the relative costs of meals consumed in fast-food restaurants, full-service restaurants, and meals prepared at home._ Chou 2002
