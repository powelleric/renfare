# Farms have declining profits

The study from Sustain compares the profit received by farmers from various retail streams.  It found that they recieve more profit from streams with shorter-supply chains.

"[T]his work suggests farmers received less than 1% of profits if supplying a supermarket chain. Instead, profits are directed to intermediaries like processors, transport companies and retailers. By contrast, in shorter chains run by social enterprises like vegetable box schemes and co-ops, more value reached farmers and their workers."
