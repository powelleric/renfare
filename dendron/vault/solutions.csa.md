Short chains allow more sophisticated information to flow. Consumer-Food Service-Farmer is a powerful one.

Consumers care about regenerative

Transparency in food service short chain is easy. Very possible to know what is in dishes and where the ingredients came from.

Food service investing in a farm via CSA is a powerful step. It aligns the fundamentals of the farm business model with the transaction itself. Payment is made up front, a nod to the fact that the farmer must invest in the crop long before it is harvested.  The items purchased are often quantified in terms of shares, indicating that yields are often uncertain.  This can greatly alleviate financial pressure on the farmer when crops do not perform well.  By the same token, when crops do perform well, bigger volumes of produce are given for each CSA.  In this way, the CSA model mimics investment in the farm itself, giving purchasers more in good times and less in bad times.  

This is a powerful factor in the context of regenerative agriculture in which farms must take on risk and uncertainty in making changes to their business model.

Moreover, CSA represents a guaranteed off-take model.

This is another case of a common model that would be more powerful if driven by food service rather than the consumer.  Transaction costs are too high for the consumer.
