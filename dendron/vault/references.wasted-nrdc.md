Wasted: How America Is Losing Up to 40 Percent of Its Food from Farm to Fork to Landfill

A veritable laundry-list of food waste remedies.

While the report does an outstanding job at being a comprehensive food waste resource, it does little to compare the relative merits of the many solutions.  From telling your friends about the importance of food waste to standardizing food waste metrics in the federal government, there are efforts at every conceivable level and with every imaginable stakeholder.

 family to waste less to  Hard to know which ones have most potential.

- Great infographic on all the resources that go into making the food that we waste

- ReFED estimates are 21% agricultural water use, 19 pecent crop-land, and 18% fertilizer use goes toward food that is wasted.

- The UK managed to reduce food waste. 

  - "Wasting less food can help stabilize food demand even as population grows, as was demonstrated in the United Kingdom, where the population grew 4.5 percent but total food demand stayed constant (while wasted food declined).

- Casts the problem onto the consumer.  "We weren’t always this wasteful."

  - "[L]earning when food is (and isn’t) bad to eat, correctly interpreting date labels, and buying the right amount of food to begin with

  - "POOR PLANNING: Consumers may overbuy because they fail to plan meals, fail to use a shopping list, inaccurately estimate what is needed for meal preparation, or decide on impromptu restaurant meals.

- Pie chart of waste in supply chain and waste by category

- EPA identified "source reduction" as the most important means of reducing waste. "Reduce the volume of surplus food generated"

- "A study from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimated that about one-third of the world’s food supply never makes it to a mouth."

- "The meat industry is relatively adept at finding secondary and tertiary markets for most parts of the animal."

- "Community-supported agriculture (CSA) arrangements link farmers and ranchers directly with consumers, who share some of the production risk by paying an up- front subscription fee. Subscribers receive whatever
is available, which may be influenced by weather variations and other factors. In the past few years, larger companies have adopted similar models. For example, Google promises up front to buy a fixed dollar amount of produce from nearby Pie Ranch for the cafés at its headquarters in Mountain View, California"

- "Instant alerts can help find produce a home. Feeding America’s Produce Matchmaker platform helps connect large produce loads with food banks and enabled
125 million pounds of produce to be donated in 2016 alone.119 On a smaller scale, Cropmobster in California distributes instant online alerts about agricultural surpluses. Since 2013, this tool has helped save more than two million pounds of locally grown, nutritious food in the San Francisco Bay Area.120"

- "Loss rates averaged 12.3 percent for fruit and 11.6 percent for vegetables. That’s enough fruit to meet the government dietary guidelines for more than 5.3 million people and enough vegetables for nearly 3.9 million people every day of the year. Losses vary widely by produce type. For instance, the rate was only 2 percent for sweet corn and 4 percent for bananas versus 43 percent for papayas and 63 percent for turnip greens."

- "Part of the allure of supermarkets is that they carry a vast array of products at every hour of the day—usually between 15,000 and 60,000 items. While convenient, this bounty presents a challenge for forecasting and inventory management and inevitably leads to waste."

- Successful case study in selling a non-traditional product

  - "Its web platform affords unlimited space and the ability to tell the stories of various products, which can help sell nontraditional products. For instance, in the first six weeks that hens lay eggs, the eggs are typically smaller than the market desires. Yet FreshDirect has created a steady demand for these “pullet” eggs by working with an organic egg producer and telling this story online. That strategy has brought good value to customers and additional revenue to the producer by allowing them to sell a traditionally unused product."

- "A separate problem with grouped products is that if one item in the package—for instance an apple in a bag or one egg in a carton—is damaged, often the whole thing will be thrown out."

- "None of the above retail estimates include the critical role of food retailers in influencing losses both up and down the supply chain.176 Anecdotally, it’s said that large commercial food buyers can demand tough contract terms, including quantity guarantees and the ability to change orders at the last minute. Growers often overplant beyond their contracts to make sure they can fulfill them even in the event of bad weather or pest damage."

- "Households are responsible for the largest portion of
all food waste."

- "A McKinsey Consulting study reports that household losses are responsible for an average of eight times the energy waste of post-harvest losses."

- "food sold in package sizes larger than needed can lead
to food spoilage. Furthermore, store promotions that encourage bulk purchases or purchases of unnecessary products often lead consumers to buy foods outside their typical meal plan, which then leads to waste."

- "Chefs around the country are embracing the challenge of using oft-wasted ingredients. In one example, more than 30 world leaders were served “landfill salad” and other repurposed items at a United Nations lunch in 2015."
