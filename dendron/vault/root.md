# Welcome to Renaissance Fare

Renaissance Fare (RF) is a radical vision for our food service industry. It explores the potential societal benefits that could come from a business model designed around cheap, healthy and readily-available food service.  -- and what that might look like and what it mightentail.

RF looks to the fundamental principles of our ecosystem and our economy to inspire more effective use our resources. In doing so, it seeks not just  greater efficiency at the business-level but also systemic changes in business incentives and equitable allocations amongst stakeholders. 

To realize this goal, RF seeks to align the fundamental principles of our ecosystem and our economy to make more effective use of our resources. 

While food service is the hub of the system, the impact of this business model can be felt upstream in the argricultural industry.
