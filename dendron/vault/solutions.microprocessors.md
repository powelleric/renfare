"Some surplus or products that do not meet specifications in major fresh markets can be used in the processing sector (e.g., apples may be used for applesauce, apple juice, frozen apple pie). However, many cannot. Most large processors, such as canneries, freezing operations, and prepared food manufacturers, have advance contracts with suppliers as well as strict requirements for the timing of planting and harvesting, seed varieties, and growing practices. Large processors also typically receive product via large semi-trucks and are not equipped to process smaller quantities efficiently. Even if a facility is willing and able to accept the produce, it must be close enough to justify transportation costs, and it must have the capacity to process the product at the right moment, which often conflicts with its existing operations.

Food safety scares can also spur crop losses, not only from immediate recalls associated with actual food
safety concerns, but also from the hysteria that often ensues. In 2008, for example, the FDA issued a warning about possible salmonella contamination in tomatoes. Although the warning was eventually declared unfounded, consumers developed a negative perception and overall tomato demand decreased. As a result, some 32 percent of total U.S. tomato acreage went unharvested that year, leading to massive losses for tomato farmers and massive waste.87 Even warranted recalls lead to much good food going to wasteâ€”a tradeoff of keeping our food safe."
