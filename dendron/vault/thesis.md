The central idea of RF is that many of our issues are systemic, such that the "choices" we make are influenced by the system itself; Choices that favor key stakeholders in the system tend to be incentived. This means that trying to alter consumers' choices is an uphill battle. And while it may be regretable that our choices often lead to such poor health and environmental outcomes, it is another thing to suggest that those choices weren't in each individual's best interest at the time.

trying to alleviate them by changing our behaviors and making more informed choices at the individual level - as noble as that might be

Rather than trying to persuade the consumer to choose one of the other existing options, the goal of RF is to offer a new option that is more attractive to the consumer __and__ that is aligned with our long-term societal goals.

style of food service that can offer cheaper, healthier and more-convenient offerings. 

In short, RF introduces a new and better option rather than beating the already-dead horse of moral suasion. 

It is an inherantly self-affirming philosophy. It endows the consumer with full knowledge of the environmental and health considerations surrounding their decision.  Moreover, it asserts that they value these outcomes in their decision.  It is not that they are ignorant or that they don't care; They simply have not been sufficiently incentivized.

A good analogy is an election. You must choose amongst the available candidates regardless of whether you agree perfectly with any of them.  On the whole, you may actually dislike the person you choose, but just a bit less than the others.  In this context, it is clear that equating someone's vote to their personal values is foolish. In the same way, the consumer votes with their dollars, and just because some people seem to habitually make the same food choices, it does not mean that they are married to those choices.  They very well may be dissatisfied with the choices but unable to find a better option.

It is one thing to vote because you believe in the value of elections in society, it is quite another thing to vote because you believe whole-heartedly in every thing a candidate has ever said.     

there are  available options The only missing piece is that they have not been offered food service has not offered an attractive option that also aligns with their values. a good option, and so it can appear that either these things are not valued or that the person is ignorant.
