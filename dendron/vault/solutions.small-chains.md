Small chains are the hope. Big corporations have broken trust. They have done crimes and while they may have been punished for them according to the justice system, the trust of the consumer is a different matter.

They have proven time and again that their best is not enough.

Need smaller groups, more dynamic. Trust each other. Shared values.  

Easier than ever to manage small chains in the digital age.  Abundance of resources.  Big companies have tons of excess and overhead.
