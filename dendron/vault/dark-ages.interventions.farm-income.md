In response to shrinking farm income, farm advocates are calling for

"Tougher regulation is needed to help redress the imbalance of power between farmers, processors and the supermarkets including maintaining the Groceries Code Adjudicator, introducing new, legally binding, sectoral supply chain codes of practice, better labelling to ensure transparency and planning rules to curb local retail dominance.
Building new better routes to market for farmers - so they have more power and gain greater value from their produce - through an action plan to increase the market share of shorter and farmer-focused supply chains, public investment in localised agri-food infrastructure (such as sorting, drying, hubs) and enterprise and using dynamic public procurement models to source from a large range of farmers and growers.
More transparency in supply chains, greater mandatory reporting and acknowledge the huge overheads in the current, complex system"
