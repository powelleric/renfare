Does not fulfill needs as an effective job qualification?

Cannot hire based on degree because not all people had equal access to the university. 

Second, universities have different standards, making it hard to know the significance of a degree. This issue cuts deep, affecting not only inter-university comparisons but even intra-university ones. The same degree may be taught by different faculty with different emphasis on content (or even different content, altogether). This problem only gets worse for degrees attained at different times.

Therefore, it is almost impossible for someone in a hiring position to know anything concrete about what you learned and how you performed.

Finally, small peer group in universities. Curves, etc.  Poor test design.

Coursera is better.  Everyone gets the same.  Better ability to compare between candidates.

Universities are all or nothing making them punishing and high-stakes.  What's more, courses that are not relevant to one's interest are peppered in, increasing the cost and the possibilities of drop-out.  As a final insult to injury, credits often expire (since the content changes) nor can credits be easily transferred.  In this sense, universities betray their claims that they are offering something of any recognizable value because if they were, then it would retain that value over time and be easily recognized by others.  It is absurd that these qualities are attributed to a completed degree yet denied to the constituent credits, as if they only magically took effect when the degree was complete.

People do not attend university the older they are. This excludes people who are motivated to advance in their occupation but already have financial and family obligations.  Therefore, college degrees select for individuals who were high-achieving early in life, while under the watch of their parents, even.  It is a cruel model that takes a person who is motivated in their career and places a glass-ceiling above them with a requirement that, for all intensive purposes, must have been completed.  Essentially, it is a pre-requisite for higher positions, making advancement from lower positions nearly impossible.


(Also, some people had access but did not desire to go.)
