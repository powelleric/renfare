In response to shrinking farmer profits, the Sustain report called for greater transparency in the supply chain.  The intent is to be able to monitor how much farmers are receiving.

A similar concept can be applied at the business level if establishments reveal the prices they pay for their produce.  Even more so if they reveal the profits they receive from each item. Ultimately, these calculations must be done for a business to be financially sound, therefore it is more of a matter of how to publish such information.
